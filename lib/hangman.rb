    # 1. When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly select...
    # a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word. (COMPLETE)

    # 2. Draw a stick figure as the game goes on and display a count so the player knows how many more... 
    # incorrect guesses they have before the game ends. 
    
    # 3. You should display which CORRECT letters have already been chosen...
    # (and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which INCORRECT letters have already been chosen. (COMPLETE)

    # 4. Every turn, allow the player to make a case insensitive guess of a letter. Update the display for correct or incorrect. 
    # If out of guesses, the player should lose. (COMPLETE)

    # 5. Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn, instead of making a guess 
    # the player should also have the option to save the game. 
    # Remember what you learned about serializing objectsâ€¦ you can serialize your game class too!  (COMPLETE)

    # 6. When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you to open one of your saved games... 
    # which should jump you exactly back to where you were when you saved. Play on!  (COMPLETE)
