# Hangman Game README

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Ruby. The game allows a single player to play against the computer, guessing letters to form a word.

## Gameplay

Here's a brief overview of how the game works:

1. The computer chooses a random word from a predefined list.
2. The player is presented with a blank space representation of the word, with each letter replaced by an underscore.
3. The player makes a guess by typing a letter.
4. If the letter is correct, the computer fills in the corresponding blank space(s).
5. If the letter is incorrect, the computer draws a part of a hangman's gallows.
6. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or the gallows is complete and the player is "hanged."

## Features

* The game allows players to start a new game or load a saved game.
* Players can save their progress at any time during the game.
* The game keeps track of the number of correct and incorrect guesses.
* The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
